## Mechanical documentation

### Tank
The tank is a fully modular design for easy assembly, use and fabrication. The fully rendered image of the tank can be seen below.

### housing
The housing of the tank is made from pieces of 3mm acrylic plates glued together. The structure is a monocoque design which helps to save weight, thus increasing the protablility and reducing the cost of production. Chloroform, a type of acrylic glue, is applied to finger joints of the each plate to reinforce the integrity of the joint. 


### Mounting Structure
A mounting structure is also produced, with the purpose of mounting the housing to the tracks. As the housing have a larger footprint than the track base itself, the mounting platform is desgined in a way that it serves as an adaptor to compensate the difference in footprint. The image of the mounting structure can be seen below.

### Robot Arm
The robot arm is a arm kindly provided by our lecturer. It has 4 degrees of freedom. It is controlled by servo motors and linkages. 

### ESP CAM mount
The ESP CAM mount is used to mount the ESP camera via transition tight fit (H7/k6). It is glued to the robot arm and it is made from a single part. The image of the ESP CAM mount can be seen below.
