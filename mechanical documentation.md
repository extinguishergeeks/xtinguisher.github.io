## Mechanical documentation

### housing
The housing of the tank is made from pieces of 3mm acrylic plates glued together. The structure is a monocoque design which helps to save weight, thus increasing the protablility and reducing the cost of production. Chloroform, a type of acrylic glue, is applied to finger joints of the each plate to reinforce the integrity of the joint. 



### Mounting Structure
A mounting structure is also produced, with the purpose of mounting the housing to the tracks. As the housing have a larger footprint than the track base itself, the mounting platform is desgined in a way that it serves as an adaptor to compensate the difference in footprint. The image of the mounting structure can be seen below

### Robot Arm
The robot arm is a arm kindly provided by our lecturer. It has 4 degrees of freedom. It is controlled by servo motors and linkages.
