## Welcome

This git repository serves as a platform to us to document our tank. We are working on a bomb disposal robot tank that helps war torn civilians safely and easily defuse bombs without calling in EOD teams

### Problem background

After a war, there are many unexploded bombs or mines leftover that may threaten civilian lives. So, we decided to conceive a way for civilians to safely dispose of bombs with minimal training.

### Problem statement

“How are we able to assist with bomb disposal”

### main features of the tank

- Robotic arm with 4 Degrees of freedom (DOF)
- Modular housing and design
- Camera mounted on the arm for larger field of view during operation
- WiFi web control for easier training… control from phone instead of specialised panel
